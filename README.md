- 👋 Hi, I’m @jleuang594
- 👀 I’m interested in learning tag implementations, QA, data sourcing, and other things not related to tech. Such as fitness, eco-sustainability, living minimally, home technology and more. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to apply all of what I learned to solving real world business problems. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on gaining more new knowledge on the things I don't know and asking questions!
- 📫 How to reach me...
